I'm (re-)Learning Git &amp; GitHub

Years ago, I started using Git, but had to put it on the back burner.  Now it's cold,  and needs re-warming.  I've used Tortoise SVN a little bit, but I'm even rusty enough on that, so the Hare would win that race too, if I tried to compete without some revisits to the kitchen...

I am an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Missouri University of Science and Technology.  I have taught here for 30 years and I am now also the president of the Missouri S&T graduate faculty. I have been a father for about 30 years, and now I am a grandfather to two grand children and step-grandfather to two step-grandsons.  
I have had several graduate students and undergraduate research students over the course of my career to now, though my "school" is by no means an army yet, and currently I have two PhD students.  We work in Universal Algebra, Lattice Theory, and logic, but I have other projects with colleagues, some of whom are former students in topology and its applications, (theoretical) computer science, engineering (applying PDEs), and educational technology, applying some new hyperspace metrics to help with grading graphs.
